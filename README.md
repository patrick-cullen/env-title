Ever had local, QA, and production tabs of the same application all open at the same time? It can be easy to mix them up and waste precious time and attention keeping them straight.

This utility package creates a blade component that prepends the HTML document title (what shows in a browser tab) with the environment that the application is running in- unless it's production, in which case it is treated as a regular `<title>` tag.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require patrick-cullen/env-title
```

Note that you may need to add the -W flag if a dependency of env-title such as "spatie/laravel-package-tools" is required by other packages in your project and is installed at a version below the required versions for env-title. 
Alternatively, run:

```bash
composer update
```

before installing this package via composer. 

The installation script will handle the rest:

```bash
php artisan env-title:install
```

Now just replace your `<title>` tags with `<x-env-title>` blade components, and you're good to go.

## Installing Dev Versions

When installing dev versions of this package be sure to change the "minimum-stability" property in your project's composer.json file to "dev" before following the above installation steps.

<!--
You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="env-title-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
];
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
